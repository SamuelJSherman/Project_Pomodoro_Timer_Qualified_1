# Pomodoro Timer
Pomodoro Timer Skills used: React, JSX, and Bootstrap. The Pomodoro application sets a focus and break time; aiming to help a user complete their dedicated task at hand more efficiently. The focus and break duration are set at the discretion of the user, with a 60 minute max focus time, and 1 minute minimum break time. Once the allotted session time finishes, the next session begins itâ€™s countdown. A user will see a progress bar below the countdown, and hear a bell at the end of the current session.
